DOCUMENTATION

Installation
Upload the 'filemanager' folder where you want in your server (in the example is on root).
Create a folder for your uploaded files and give it write permission (755).
Open filemanager/config/config.php and edit the settings (read config.php parameters setting paragraph). Save file.
Subscribe to Aviary.com to get a free app key (NB the free account limits the export of images to a maximum of 800x800 pixels) 
NB Aviary Editor only works online; it won't work on localhost!!
Great! Your work is finished!
PS If you don't see the preview images you need to give write permission to the thumbs folder.
If you are updating from a previous version of FileManager delete the contents of thumbs folder, the script will automatically re-create the thumbnails.

!IMPORTANT: if you are using htaccess protection, make sure your $GLOBALS PHP_AUTH_USER/PHP_AUTH_USER are defined in your webserver config

USE AS TINYMCE 4 FILE MANAGER

Copy tinymce/plugins/responsivefilemanager folder to tinymce/plugins/ in your server
N.B.: REMEMBER THAN RESPONVIVEFILEMANAGER IS NOT FILEMANAGER FOLDER BUT AN ADDITIONAL PLUGIN
Settings of tinymce should be like this: (remember to add responsivefilemanager in plugins list):

 tinymce.init({
    selector: "textarea",theme: "modern",width: 680,height: 300,
    plugins: [
         "advlist autolink link image lists charmap print preview hr anchor pagebreak",
         "searchreplace wordcount visualblocks visualchars insertdatetime media nonbreaking",
         "table contextmenu directionality emoticons paste textcolor responsivefilemanager"
   ],
   toolbar1: "undo redo | bold italic underline | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | bullist numlist outdent indent | styleselect",
   toolbar2: "| responsivefilemanager | link unlink anchor | image media | forecolor backcolor  | print preview code ",
   image_advtab: true ,
   
   external_filemanager_path:"/filemanager/",
   filemanager_title:"Responsive Filemanager" ,
   external_plugins: { "filemanager" : "/filemanager/plugin.min.js"}
 });

You can pass this variables on TinyMCE init.
filemanager_title the title of filemanager window default="Responsive filemanager"
filemanager_sort_by: the element to sorting (values: name,size,extension,date) default="" 
filemanager_descending: descending ? or ascending (values=true or false) default="false" 

If you want full path url in tinyMCE paths you can add relative_urls: false on tinyMCE init (read tinyMCE Configuration page)
external_filemanager_path and external_plugins path must be absolute from root and must point to filemanager folder not responsivefilemanager plugin folder
Change the path in your tinymce init function in external_filemanager_path and external_plugins (the path must be a absolute path from base_url of your site and must start with / so in this example i have the filemanager folder in www.site.com/filemanager/)
If you are updating from older version (from 1 to 7) substitute your tinyMCE with new or download only the image/media/link originals folders and copy in your tinyMCE plugin folder

USE AS STAND-ALONE FILE MANAGER

You can use normal pop-up, Bootstrap modal, iframe, FancyBox iframe, Lightbox iframe to open the FileManager with these paths:

Only open filemanager(type=0 and not set field_id): 
path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=0&fldr=

Select Image: (type=1 and set id of input text in field_id variable):
path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=1&field_id=fieldID

Select Video: (type=3 and set id of input text in field_id variable): 
path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=3&field_id=fieldID

Select File: (type=2 and set id of input text in field_id variable): 
path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=2&field_id=fieldID

Get Variables list
type: the type of filemanager (1:images files 2:all files 3:video files)
fldr: the folder where i enter (the root folder remains the same). default=""
sort_by: the element to sorting (values: name,size,extension,date) default="" 
descending: descending? or ascending (values=true or false) default="false" 
lang: the language code (es: &lang=en_EN). default="en_EN"
relative_url: should be	added to the request with a value of "1" when opening RFM. Otherwise returned URL-s will be absolute.

If you want use popup add in the address &popup=1

PS If you want to force loading at root set fldr to /

In demo page i use FancyBox with this configuration:

     $('.iframe-btn').fancybox({	
	'width'		: 900,
	'height'	: 600,
	'type'		: 'iframe',
        'autoScale'    	: false
    });
and the button has this code to open FileManager:

 <a href="js/tinymce/plugins/filemanager/dialog.php?type=0" class="btn iframe-btn" type="button">Open Filemanager</a>
Remember to include FancyBox, file in head section:

 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.css" media="screen" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js"></script>
If you not use FancyBox, you must change the function to close the windows after file selection in filemanager/js/include.js:

 function close_window() {
    parent.$.fancybox.close();
} 
CALLBACK FUNCTION CALL after update a field
If you want change something on returned url after RFM click on a file; you can define the responsive_filemanager_callback function like this example:

function responsive_filemanager_callback(field_id){
	console.log(field_id);
	var url=jQuery('#'+field_id).val();
	alert('update '+field_id+" with "+url);
	//your code
}
SECURITY ON RESPONSIVE FILEMANAGER
In config.php there is a part reserved to security pass

define('USE_ACCESS_KEYS', FALSE);
if set to true only those will access RF whose url contains the access key(akey) like:
< input type="button" href="../filemanager/dialog.php?field_id=imgField&lang=en_EN&akey=myPrivateKey" value="Files">
in tinymce a new parameter added: filemanager_access_key:"myPrivateKey" example tinymce config: tiny init ...

external_filemanager_path:"../filemanager/",
filemanager_title:"Filemanager" ,
filemanager_access_key:"myPrivateKey" ,
In addition to this simple implementation there isn't security, because every php files include first config/config.php file.

So if you want to permit access only to a logged users you can add all the controls at beginning of config.php file.

TRANSLITERATION and STRING CONVERSION
With standard configuration responsive filemanager accepts all type of characters for file and folder names (like à é & ¥..., arabian, Chinese), if you want permits only latin charachters like A....Z a....z and 0....9, you can set to true the $transliteration variable on config.php .

SET SUBFOLDER AS ROOT AND MULTI-USER USE
You can set a subfolder as root.
So you can have a root folder for each user.

The way to implement this is set the session variable $_SESSION["RF"]["subfolder"] ="subfolder/name/"

Remember that subfolder value must not have ../ ./ . inside and can't begin with /

Folder Example:

root
-- folder1
---- subfolder1
---- subfolder2
-- folder2
----subfolder3

User1 subfolder=""
View:
folder1
-- subfolder1
-- subfolder2
folder2
-- subfolder3

User 2 subfolder="folder1"
View:
subfolder1
subfolder2

So if you want use filemanager in a multiuser CMS you can simply create a folder for each user and set a session variable ($_SESSION['subfolder']) with the name of the user folder.

CUSTOMISE CONFIGURATION FOR EACH FOLDER (CONFIG.PHP)
In FileManager Version you can customise the config.php for each folder. 
Simply create a config.php file inside your desired folder, and add the php variables that you wish to change. (Don't change $current_path,$upload_dir,$base_url,$root variables). 
You can also include an HTML text in the display folder page by simply inserting : $folder_message="html message" inside the config.php file in the folder. 
You can use this to specify the restriction or image resize.

Remember that the configuration of one folder is reflected in all its subdirectories.
CROSS DOMAIN USE
STAND-ALONE FILE MANAGER

To enable cross-domain file selector, where files are hosted on one server (for example, serverA.com) and URL is being sent to another (for example, serverB.com), include crossdomain=1 in the URL.

For example, to instantiate image picker, use the following URL: http://serverA.com/[path to filemanager]/filemanager/dialog.php?type=1&field_id=fieldID&crossdomain=1

Then on serverB.com, the following code can be used to retrieve the URL after file selection is made. Please note, that the code is written for jQuery with FancyBox plug-in.

 	//
// Handles message from ResponsiveFilemanager
//
function OnMessage(e){
  var event = e.originalEvent;
   // Make sure the sender of the event is trusted
   if(event.data.sender === 'responsivefilemanager'){
      if(event.data.field_id){
      	var fieldID=event.data.field_id;
      	var url=event.data.url;
	$('#'+fieldID).val(url).trigger('change');
	$.fancybox.close();

	// Delete handler of the message from ResponsiveFilemanager
	$(window).off('message', OnMessage);
      }
   }
}

// Handler for a message from ResponsiveFilemanager
$(‘.opener-class).on('click',function(){
  $(window).on('message', OnMessage);
});
FILE MANAGER AS TINYMCE PLUG-IN

There is extra parameter needed filemanager_crossdomain when calling tinymce.init(), please see below.

 tinymce.init({
   ...
   filemanager_crossdomain: true,
   external_filemanager_path:"http://path/secondaryserver/filemanager/",
   external_plugins: { "filemanager" : "http://path/secondaryserver/filemanager/plugin.min.js"},
   ...
});
